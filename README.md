# code-this-quiz

For this coding-quiz project, I tried to make the project look exactly like the mock-up that was provided in class, both in appearance and functionality.
At the beginning of this project, I realized quickly that if I just tried to re-create the appearance of the mock-up, I wouldn't have to write as much code in my html and CSS files. 
Unlike previous challenges, this coding quiz project didn't require much CSS code. There was no need to add a header, body, various div and section elements, or a footer. This challenge was more focused on functionality using Javascript.

Before I wrote any html, css, or JS code, the first priority was to write psuedo-code to help organize my thoughts and the order of steps I needed to take in order to satisfy all of the requirements.  

After I had written the psuedo-code, I started by first creating the outlines for the HTML, CSS and Javascript files. During the first half of the project, I mainly focused more on functionality in the JS file, rather than appearance. 
After I had finished with the JS code, I back-tracked through the html and CSS files to make sure the project resembled the mock-up. 

I then created a 2nd html and JS file for the high-scores page after I initially had tried to put all of the code for the 2 pages within the html and JS files. The last objective involved creating comments for all 3 of the files, and testing out the finished code before submitting.
